This is for turbogears there is a sample here http://www.openschooltech.com/cal

There is a field for event type where I use options in the form.

The model will have to be incorporated into your project  - -        imported to __init__ and Controller.

The DB will have to be setup  - -              paster setup-app ['development.ini'] or whatever and don't forget to delete old devdata first.

I included some javascript in the template, but it can be moved.  this is just to navigate from month to month.


Just put the python code for the controller into your project and navigate to  yourproject/cal.  

Amazing.
